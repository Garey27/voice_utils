Package Structure
-----------------
Say the upstream SoX version is 14.4.1. The orig tarball is created by renaming
sox-14.4.1.tar.gz to sox_14.4.1.orig.tar.gz .

Modifying and Patching the Source
---------------------------------
Patches are or can be applied using quilt. See the excellent tutorial on how to
use quilt by RaphaÃ«l Hertzog:
